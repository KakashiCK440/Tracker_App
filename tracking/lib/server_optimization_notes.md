# Server-Side Optimization Recommendations

To further improve the performance of the object tracking system, consider implementing the following server-side optimizations:

## 1. Increase Confidence Threshold

In the detector.py file, increase the confidence threshold to reduce false positives:

```python
# Change from
results = model(image, conf=0.1, iou=0.5)

# To
results = model(image, conf=0.3, iou=0.5)  # or even 0.5 for higher confidence
```

## 2. Improve Bounding Box Validation

In the deepsort_tracker.py file, enhance the `is_valid_bbox()` function to filter out tiny detections:

```python
def is_valid_bbox(bbox):
    """
    Ensure bbox=(l, t, r, b) is non-empty and has at least 10px in each dimension.
    """
    if len(bbox) != 4:
        return False
    l, t, r, b = bbox
    return (r > l) and (b > t) and (r - l) > 10 and (b - t) > 10  # Increased minimum size
```

## 3. Return Normalized Coordinates

Modify the router.py file to return normalized coordinates (between 0-1) instead of pixel coordinates:

```python
# In the /detect endpoint
for result in track_results:
    x1, y1, x2, y2, track_id, class_id = result
    
    # Normalize coordinates
    norm_x1 = x1 / image.shape[1]
    norm_y1 = y1 / image.shape[0]
    norm_x2 = x2 / image.shape[1]
    norm_y2 = y2 / image.shape[0]
    
    detection_boxes.append(
        DetectionBox(
            id=int(track_id) if track_id >= 0 else -1,
            label="person",
            confidence=float(detections[0][4]) if len(detections) > 0 else 0.0,
            x1=norm_x1,
            y1=norm_y1,
            x2=norm_x2,
            y2=norm_y2
        )
    )
```

## 4. Implement WebSocket Support

Add WebSocket support to the FastAPI server for persistent connections:

```python
from fastapi import WebSocket

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    try:
        while True:
            # Receive image data
            data = await websocket.receive_bytes()
            
            # Process image and detect objects
            # ...
            
            # Send results back
            await websocket.send_json({"results": detection_boxes})
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        print("Client disconnected")
```

## 5. Optimize Memory Usage

Reduce memory usage by processing smaller images and cleaning up resources:

```python
# In router.py
MAX_WIDTH = 480  # Reduce from 640
MAX_HEIGHT = 480  # Reduce from 640

# After processing
del processed_image
del image
gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection
```

## 6. Batch Processing

Consider implementing batch processing for multiple frames at once to reduce overhead.

## 7. Caching

Implement caching for frequently detected objects to reduce processing time.

These optimizations should significantly improve the performance of the object tracking system, especially on resource-constrained devices.
